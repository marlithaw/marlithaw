                    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Provide sentence frames with designated spaces for each type of prepositional phrase. Offer word banks with suggested objects for each preposition (e.g., for "under": the table, the tree, the bridge).</li>
                    <li><strong>Extension:</strong> Challenge advanced students to create "adjective + object" combinations in their prepositional phrases for more precise description (e.g., "under the ancient oak tree" instead of just "under the tree"). Have them experiment with placing prepositional phrases in different positions within sentences.</li>
                    <li><strong>ELL Support:</strong> Provide visual supports for common prepositions. Allow students to work with a language buddy to develop phrases before writing independently. Create a personal reference guide with function-specific phrases they can use across writing tasks.</li>

                                <p>*Begin with the informational paragraph, highlighting phrases*</p>
                                <p>"In the informational paragraph, notice the prepositional phrases: 'near the equator,' 'throughout the year,' 'in different layers,' 'from the forest floor,' 'to the emergent layer,' 'within these ecosystems,' 'during recent decades,' 'because of human activities.'"</p>
                                <p>"These phrases focus on providing precise factual details about location, time periods, and cause-effect relationships. They help the author achieve the purpose of informing readers with accurate, specific information. The 'where' phrases establish the exact location of rainforests and their internal structure. The 'when' phrases provide scientific time context. Notice how objective and factual these phrases are."</p>
                                <p>*Move to the narrative paragraph, highlighting phrases*</p>
                                <p>"In the narrative paragraph, the phrases include: 'through the dense undergrowth,' 'during the early morning mist,' 'with mysterious sounds,' 'over her head,' 'into the emerald canopy,' 'with cautious steps,' 'along the narrow path,' 'behind a massive fallen tree.'"</p>
                                <p>"These phrases create vivid imagery and sensory details to engage the reader's imagination. They help the author achieve the purpose of entertaining by building a realistic scene we can picture. Notice the descriptive adjectives within the prepositional phrases—'dense undergrowth,' 'early morning mist,' 'mysterious sounds,' 'emerald canopy,' 'cautious steps,' 'narrow path,' 'massive fallen tree.' These create a mood of mystery and adventure."</p>
                                <p>*Move to the persuasive paragraph, highlighting phrases*</p>
                                <p>"In the persuasive paragraph, the phrases include: 'without immediate action,' 'from our planet,' 'throughout the world,' 'at an alarming rate,' 'for the sake of future generations,' 'with stronger regulations,' 'beyond our lifetime,' 'through conservation efforts.'"</p>
                                <p>"These phrases emphasize urgency and consequences to convince the reader to take action. They help the author achieve the purpose of persuading by creating emotional impact and suggesting solutions. Phrases like 'without immediate action,' 'at an alarming rate,' and 'for the sake of future generations' create a sense of urgency and moral responsibility."</p>

                                <p>Informational: "Oceans cover approximately 71% of Earth's surface. Within the ocean depths, water pressure increases at a rate of one atmosphere for every 10 meters of depth. During the day, light penetrates only to about 200 meters below the surface. Because of these conditions, creatures in the deep ocean have adapted with special features. Throughout marine ecosystems, animals and plants exist in a delicate balance."</p>
                                <p>Narrative: "Beneath the sparkling waves, Jo felt a sense of freedom. With steady kicks, she propelled herself along the coral reef. Among the colorful fish, she discovered a small octopus hiding inside a crevice. Throughout her dive, Jo took photographs with her underwater camera. After twenty minutes, she reluctantly swam toward the surface with amazing memories."</p>
                                <p>Persuasive: "Despite our dependence on oceans for survival, we continue to pollute these vital waters with dangerous chemicals. Throughout coastal regions, plastic waste washes up on once-pristine beaches. Without significant changes in our behavior, marine life will continue to suffer from our carelessness. For the health of our planet, we must reduce plastic usage in our daily lives. Through simple actions, like using reusable bags and bottles, we can make a difference."</p>
