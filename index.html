        <img src="/api/placeholder/400/200" alt="Animals in underground burrows">
        <p>Many animals make their homes <span class="affix-highlight">underground</span>. Rabbits dig <span class="affix-highlight">burrows</span> with many <span class="affix-highlight">tunnels</span> and rooms. These <span class="affix-highlight">underground</span> homes keep rabbits <span class="affix-highlight">safer</span> from <span class="affix-highlight">predators</span> that want to eat them. Ants build <span class="affix-highlight">amazing</span> <span class="affix-highlight">colonies</span> with <span class="affix-highlight">hundreds</span> of <span class="affix-highlight">connected</span> tunnels. Prairie dogs create whole <span class="affix-highlight">underground</span> towns where they live <span class="affix-highlight">together</span>. Being <span class="affix-highlight">underground</span> helps these animals stay <span class="affix-highlight">cooler</span> in summer and <span class="affix-highlight">warmer</span> in winter.</p>

        <img src="/api/placeholder/400/200" alt="Water cycle diagram">
        <p>Water is always <span class="affix-highlight">moving</span> around our Earth in a cycle. The sun <span class="affix-highlight">heats</span> water in oceans, lakes, and rivers. The <span class="affix-highlight">heated</span> water turns into water vapor and <span class="affix-highlight">rises</span> into the sky. This is called <span class="affix-highlight">evaporation</span>. As water vapor <span class="affix-highlight">cools</span>, it forms clouds through <span class="affix-highlight">condensation</span>. When clouds get too <span class="affix-highlight">heavy</span>, water <span class="affix-highlight">falls</span> back to Earth as rain or snow. This is <span class="affix-highlight">precipitation</span>. The water then <span class="affix-highlight">collects</span> in oceans, lakes, and rivers, and the cycle <span class="affix-highlight">restarts</span>.</p>

        <p><span class="affix-highlight">Recycling</span> means using things again instead of <span class="affix-highlight">throwing</span> them away. Many items we use daily can be <span class="affix-highlight">recycled</span>. Paper can be <span class="affix-highlight">reused</span> to make new paper products. Plastic bottles can be <span class="affix-highlight">remade</span> into new bottles or <span class="affix-highlight">clothing</span>. Metal cans are <span class="affix-highlight">melted</span> down and <span class="affix-highlight">reshaped</span>. <span class="affix-highlight">Recycling</span> helps keep our planet <span class="affix-highlight">cleaner</span> and <span class="affix-highlight">healthier</span>. It also <span class="affix-highlight">reduces</span> the amount of trash in <span class="affix-highlight">landfills</span>.

        <img src="/api/placeholder/400/200" alt="Plant diagram showing parts">
        <p>Plants have many important parts that help them grow and live. The <span class="affix-highlight">roots</span> grow <span class="affix-highlight">underground</span> and take in water and <span class="affix-highlight">nutrients</span>. The stem <span class="affix-highlight">supports</span> the plant and <span class="affix-highlight">carries</span> water up to the leaves. Leaves are like solar panels that <span class="affix-highlight">collect</span> sunlight to make food in a process called <span class="affix-highlight">photosynthesis</span>. Many plants grow <span class="affix-highlight">colorful</span> flowers that <span class="affix-highlight">attract</span> <span class="affix-highlight">pollinators</span> like bees and <span class="affix-highlight">butterflies</span>.

        <p>Animals have different types of <span class="affix-highlight">coverings</span> that <span class="affix-highlight">protect</span> them.

Fish have <span class="affix-highlight">scales</span> that <span class="affix-highlight">overlap</span> like tiny <span class="affix-highlight">shields</span>. Mammals have fur or hair that can be <span class="affix-highlight">thick</span> or <span class="affix-highlight">thin</span> <span class="affix-highlight">depending</span> on where they live. Some animals like turtles have <span class="affix-highlight">hardened</span> shells for <span class="affix-highlight">protection</span>. Insects have <span class="affix-highlight">exoskeletons</span>, which are hard <span class="affix-highlight">coverings</span> on the <span class="affix-highlight">outside</span> of their bodies.

Eagles have <span class="affix-highlight">powerful</span> <span class="affix-highlight">eyesight</span> and can see tiny animals from high in the sky. Bats use <span class="affix-highlight">echolocation</span>, <span class="affix-highlight">sending</span> out sounds that <span class="affix-highlight">bounce</span> back to help them "see" in the dark. Some snakes can <span class="affix-highlight">sense</span> heat, <span class="affix-highlight">allowing</span> them to find warm animals even at night when it's <span class="affix-highlight">completely</span> dark.</p>

Dandelion seeds are <span class="affix-highlight">carried</span> this way. Some plants have seeds with <span class="affix-highlight">hooks</span> that <span class="affix-highlight">attach</span> to animal fur or people's <span class="affix-highlight">clothing</span>. These <span class="affix-highlight">hitchhikers</span> can <span class="affix-highlight">travel</span> far from their parent plant. Some plants <span class="affix-highlight">package</span> their seeds in <span class="affix-highlight">tasty</span> fruits. When animals eat the fruit, they <span class="affix-highlight">deposit</span> the seeds later in a new place.

        <img src="/api/placeholder/400/200" alt="Human muscular system">
        <p>Your body has over 600 muscles that help you move and do <span class="affix-highlight">activities</span>. Muscles work by <span class="affix-highlight">contracting</span> (getting <span class="affix-highlight">shorter</span>) and <span class="affix-highlight">relaxing</span> (getting <span class="affix-highlight">longer</span>). Some muscles you can control, like the ones that help you <span class="affix-highlight">walk</span>, <span class="affix-highlight">jump</span>, and <span class="affix-highlight">smile</span>. Other muscles work <span class="affix-highlight">automatically</span>, like your heart, which is a <span class="affix-highlight">powerful</span> muscle that pumps blood. <span class="affix-highlight">Exercise</span> makes muscles <span class="affix-highlight">stronger</span> and <span class="affix-highlight">healthier</span>. When you <span class="affix-highlight">stretch</span> before <span class="affix-highlight">activity</span>, you help <span class="affix-highlight">prevent</span> <span class="affix-highlight">injuries</span>. <span class="affix-highlight">Resting</span> is also important because it gives muscles time to <span class="affix-highlight">repair</span> and grow.</p>

        <p>Insects are the most <span class="affix-highlight">successful</span> animals on Earth, with more kinds than any other animal group. All insects have three main body parts: the head, thorax, and <span class="affix-highlight">abdomen</span>. On their heads, insects have two <span class="affix-highlight">antennae</span> for <span class="affix-highlight">sensing</span> their <span class="affix-highlight">surroundings</span>. Most insects have <span class="affix-highlight">compound</span> eyes with many tiny <span class="affix-highlight">lenses</span> that help them see in <span class="affix-highlight">different</span> <span class="affix-highlight">directions</span> at once. Insects have six <span class="affix-highlight">jointed</span> legs <span class="affix-highlight">attached</span> to their thorax. Many insects have wings, which let them fly. Insects grow by <span class="affix-highlight">molting</span>, <span class="affix-highlight">shedding</span> their hard <span class="affix-highlight">exoskeleton</span> as they get <span class="affix-highlight">bigger</span>.</p>
